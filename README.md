# Liffab LED Race

This project started as a simple fork with tweaks of the original [Open LED Race](https://github.com/gbarbarov/led-race)

But it mutated into its own beast and 90% of the code was rebuilt from the ground up in C++.

This project is part of the activities of [Liffab](https://www.facebook.com/Liffab/), the maker lab of the city of Liffr√©, France.
